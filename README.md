# Web-Design
Repository for smaller web design projects, concepts, and toys made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The advanced to-do list, and color game were a part of an online web development course I took.
The omnitrix is a web toy I made using javascript.
The Instagram night mode is a concept front end project I made to display what Instagram might look like if it had a night mode like Twitter.
